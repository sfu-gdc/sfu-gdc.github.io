## fonts
- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Finlandica I'm not sure why Alex chose a font commissioned by the government of finland but this is awesome?
- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3 because I'm all in with stealing from finland, but the body font from https://www.visitfinland.com/en/ is adobe & adobe is not open (except source sans 3!)

## colours
- https://lospec.com/palette-list/pear36 this is my favourite colour palette ever, so of course I would use it
- there are a few other random colours from when Alex did it, but I think they look nice so I'm not touching it.
- I think pink & yellow is a really nice two tone design, + black/white for emphasis of course. I'm thinking colder colours like blue and green will be uncommon. But, if you decide to use those colours for a section, make sure that the section only uses that colour. We don't want to spread out random colours everywhere, that would look messy.

## design elements
- coloured banners as headers are pretty nice
- alignment is important
- avoid thin lines where possible
- take advantage of negative space to reasonably minimize clutter
- kinda cute where possible? I prefer this to the shooty shooty attitude of gaming ofc.

## images / logos
- I made a lot of logos. It was originally kinda a seasonal thing, but then we landed on a few really nice ones. I prefer the strawberry & the sword the best. Idk if we should be consistent, but there are a lot of other nice ones.
- the theme is always pixel art, but other art is okay if it's aligned nicely. google "minimalist graphic design"

## patterns
- yellow for header, orange for emphasis, pink for link.
- sometimes yellow for "header link". Yellow is super bright, so users' eyes will move towards it, which helps emphasize it as the first element in the hierarchy.
